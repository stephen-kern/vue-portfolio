    <h1>Hello, I'm {{ name }} 👋</h1>
    <p>
      A Front-End Developer passionate about building websites that are clean,
      user-friendly, and engaging.
      <br /><br />
      At Enertech Global, I maintain and improve WordPress and Joomla! sites,
      create custom PHP features, and implement AJAX-powered filtering to give
      users smooth, intuitive experiences. I thrive on solving problems,
      collaborating with teams, and writing code that’s both elegant and
      functional.
      <br /><br />
      My background includes earning a Full-Stack Development Certificate from
      Washington University in St. Louis, where I gained hands-on experience
      with React, Node, and SQL.
      <br /><br />
      My design approach leans toward clean and organic solutions, creating
      websites that feel natural, intuitive, and visually appealing while
      keeping functionality at the forefront.
      <br /><br />
      Outside of coding, you’ll find me exploring new music and art, cooking,
      riding my bike or skateboard, gaming, or planning my next travel
      adventure.
      <br /><br />
      Looking ahead, I’m excited to expand my skills into full-stack and backend
      development. I enjoy the structure, logic, and problem-solving these areas
      offer, and I’m eager to take on projects that challenge me to grow as a
      developer.
